## About KYC Requirements Report 

`KYC Requirements Report` is a research report that analyzes the KYC requirements of three crypto-remittance providers and two traditional remittance providers in Afghanistan. The report attempts to understand the Afghan KYC landscape holistically, and thus investigates surrounding historical, financial, and socio-political information, as well.

A "prework process" was included in the report, which explains the overall research process. The prework involved use of Python and web APis to help quickly describe the various countries listed in the Inca Digital Challenge.
